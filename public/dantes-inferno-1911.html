                    The classic tale of Dante's journey through Hell, loosely
                    adapted from the <em>Divine Comedy</em> and inspired by the
                    illustrations of Gustav Doré. This historically important
                    film stands as the first feature from Italy and the oldest
                    fully-surviving feature in the world, and boasts beautiful
                    sets and special effects that stand above other cinema of
                    the era.

                <p>
                    I can definitely see why this film is historically
                    important. The filmmakers clearly put great effort into the
                    wardrobe, set, and especially the special effects,
                    considering the era. The story adapts the
                    <em>Inferno</em> section of Dante's <em>Divine Comedy</em>,
                    showing Dante and Virgil touring Hell and witnessing various
                    sinners' punishments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Visually, the film looks old, but in a way that almost works
                    in its favor, adding to the horror. Being a silent film is
                    understandable for 1911, and while some moments are
                    naturally unclear due to the format, I personally find
                    silent films difficult to engage with. There are many
                    historical and mythological figures I didn't recognize,
                    which I imagine would confuse most modern viewers without
                    background knowledge of Dante's era, classical myths, or
                    Italian history.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Outside of that, the journey through Hell with Dante and
                    Virgil is portrayed fairly well, and I liked most of the
                    demon designs. That said, I was disappointed with Lucifer,
                    who didn't look as impressive as I expected. There are also
                    a few unintentionally funny moments. In particular, the
                    scene where Dante's path to the hill of salvation is blocked
                    by a she-wolf, a lion, and a panther. The she-wolf is
                    literally just a regular dog, which I found amusing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, the film works better as a piece of film history
                    than as something entertaining to watch today.
