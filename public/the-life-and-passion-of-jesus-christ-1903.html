        <!-- Explain your opinion to your reader. You have a reader who wants to know
        what you think and wants to know why you think what you think. Why did
        you like the movie? Why didn't you like the movie? What was good about
        it? What was bad about it? What was boring about it? What was exciting
        about it? Your job is to explain, not just state your opinion. Your
        opinion is your opinion but the only way you can get somebody else
        interested in it is if you can explain it. Use compelling language, -
        not just adjectives. You want to be persuasive. You want to write just
        as well when you're praising something as you do when you're attacking. -->

            For a movie made in 1903, the visuals are strikingly clear for the
            era. It's a silent film that's does fairly well for portraying the
            life of Jesus Christ. For someone who doesn't know the story of
            Jesus' life, the scenes would probably be hard to interpret what's
            going on. It can come across as pretty cheesy with some of the
            gestures and props used on set, but all in all I think it was a fair
            movie that is clear about it's intent and message.
