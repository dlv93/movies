                    When all but one child from the same class mysteriously
                    vanish on the same night at exactly the same time, a

        it? What was bad about it? What was boring about it? What was exciting
        about it? Your job is to explain, not just state your opinion. Your

                <p>
                    I liked how the movie set up the story and then unfolded by
                    showing the events through the perspectives of Justine,
                    Archer, Paul, James, Marcus, and Alex. This structure pulled
                    me into the mystery and kept me invested throughout the
                    movie. My only drawback with this approach was that I wanted
                    more from Justine and Archer's perspectives, though overall
                    it pieced together well enough that it didn't hurt the flow.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The performances across the cast were strong, with
                    believable characters, and the cinematography looked great.
                    One scene that didn't land for me was during Archer's
                    dream/astral projection, where he sees a gun above the
                    house. Even with the interpretation to the kids being
                    weaponized at 2:17, it just came across as a little goofy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also wasn't fully satisfied with the ending. I was
                    expecting something bigger or more intense. Gladys felt too
                    easily defeated, though I will admit her over-the-top chase
                    scene with the children was funny in its own ridiculous way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, <em>Weapons</em> is a solid watch with engaging
                    storytelling, strong acting, and stylish visuals, but it
                    falls short of greatness due to a weaker ending.
