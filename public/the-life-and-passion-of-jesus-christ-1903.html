                <p>
                    For a movie made in 1903, the visuals are impressively clear
                    for the era. Watching it today, though, it feels outdated
                    and not very pleasant to look at. The silent format is
                    handled fairly well for the era, though I personally find
                    silent films difficult to engage with. Separately, viewers
                    unfamiliar with the story of Jesus' life might struggle to
                    understand some scenes. Some scenes come across a bit cheesy
                    with some of the gestures and props. Despite its
                    limitations, it works better as a piece of film history than
                    as something entertaining to watch now.
