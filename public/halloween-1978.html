                    Fifteen years after murdering his sister on Halloween night

                <p>
                    I didn't find <em>Halloween</em> particulary scary or very
                    engaging, but I did enjoy some aspects. Michael Myers isn't
                    so much a character as he is a concept. He is silent,
                    robotic, and relentless, killing without motive, reaction,
                    or personality, which makes it hard to connect with the
                    threat he represents. Unlike other killers who interact with
                    their victims by taunting them, playing with them, or
                    reacting to their fear, Michael feels like a force of
                    nature. Even if the goal is to embody pure evil, it would
                    probably work better for me if the film showed more gore or
                    creative kills to make his presence feel more intense and
                    threatening.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I liked Michael's look. The mask, the oufit, and the way he
                    physically movies make him visually memorable. He also shows
                    tiny moments of goofiness, like when he's cruising near
                    Laurie, Annie, and Lynda. Lynda yells "<em
                        >Hey, jerk! Speed kills,</em
                    >
                    and Michael slams on the brakes and just sits in the middle
                    of the street, almost as if she had cursed the name of his
                    mother. Another moment is later, in the bedroom scene with
                    Lynda, he walks in wearing a bedsheet and Bob's glasses over
                    it. These brief glimpses of humor are amusing, but they
                    still don't give him much personality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The chase scenes with Laurie are the closest the movie comes
                    to being consistently entertaining. Some of it is
                    overdramatic, and her constant whimpering can be a bit
                    grating, but I'll admit these moments are the most engaging
                    part of the film. One element that does consistently work
                    for me is the iconic Michael Myers theme. The music really
                    adds tension and atmosphere, and it helps make the scenes
                    feel ominous even when the killer himself doesn't inspire
                    much fear.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I can appreciate the historical importance of
                    <em>Halloween</em>. It was one of the first films of its
                    kind and clearly influenced the slasher genre in ways we
                    still see today. I respect that and understand why it's
                    considered innovative, even though, as a modern viewer, it
                    doesn't fully engage me emotionally or scare me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, it's a technically competent and ocassionally
                    entertaining film, but as a modern viewer looking for
                    visceral tension or emotional engagement, it just doesn't
                    hit the mark for me.
