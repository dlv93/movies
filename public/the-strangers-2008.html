                <p>
                    <em>The Strangers</em> is a solid horror movie that shows
                    how much terror can come from sound alone. It builds so much
                    tension through simple noises like knocks, creaks,
                    footsteps, and moments of silence. One of my favorite
                    examples is when Merle Haggard's <em>Mama Tried</em> plays
                    on the vinyl while Mike walks through the house, unaware
                    that the burlap-masked stranger is silently following behind
                    him. The country song paired with the quiet dread of that
                    moment works perfectly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What makes the film so unsettling isn't violence, it's the
                    pursuit. The strangers are never in a rush; they toy with
                    their victims, stretching out the fear until it feels
                    unbearable. There's something deeply disturbing about how
                    casual and random their cruelty is, like they're doing it
                    just because they can. This is made even worse when, if
                    asked why they're doing it, they respond with a cold,
                    emotionless "<em>Because you were home.</em>" That simple,
                    matter-of-fact answer makes them feel utterly evil. There's
                    no motive beyond pure, senseless malice. The contrast
                    between their happy masks and their emotionless behavior
                    makes it even creepier. The burlap-sack mask with the mouth
                    line, especially, was my favorite. The stranger with this
                    mask's first scene, when he steps from around the corner
                    behind Kristen in the kitchen, is easily one of, if not the
                    most, film's most iconic moments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There isn't much of a story here, but that actually fits the
                    type of horror it's going for. It's more about atmosphere
                    and psychological torment than plot. That said, I never felt
                    much connection to Kristen. After she rejects James'
                    proposal, it's hard to sympathize with her, and the movie
                    doesn't really do much to rebuild that connection. James,
                    despite being my favorite of the two, makes a few
                    unrealistic decisions. Another thing that didn't work for me
                    were the slow-motion shots scattered throughout.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall though, <em>The Strangers</em> works. It's tense,
                    eerie, and grounded, with some moments that stick in your
                    mind after the credits roll. It's not perfect, but for what
                    it set out to be which is a simple, psychological
                    home-invasion thriller, I think it nails it.
